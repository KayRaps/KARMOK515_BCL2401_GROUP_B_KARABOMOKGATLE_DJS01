## This is a simple HTML project that includes JavaScript functionality and CSS normalization. 

**Records:**

- `index.html}: The primary HTML file that references the CSS and JavaScript files and contains the page structure.
- `index.css}: An optional CSS file to style the elements of the webpage (not included).
- `index.js}: A JavaScript file that contains the page's unique functionality (not included).

**Applications:**

Although the JavaScript file `index.js` is not specifically functional, its general structure indicates a basic webpage consisting of the following elements:

A heading element titled "Coming in hot!"
- Potentially more HTML elements that the JavaScript code could style or work with.

**Internal References:**

The "normalize.css" external library ([https://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize)) is used by the project to supply fundamental to offer rudimentary cross-browser normalization. This guarantees a more uniform foundation for layout design.
Managing the Project:

Make sure that the index.html, index.css, and index.js files are all saved in the same directory.
Click index.html to start the project in your browser.
Additional Development

To style the different HTML elements on the page (header, body, etc.), create the index.css file.
To add certain functionality or interactivity to the page, work on the index.js file. This might entail:
To react to user actions (clicks, form submissions, etc.), event listeners can be added.
dynamically altering the page's content or style by working with the Document Object Model (DOM).
utilizing JavaScript frameworks or libraries for more sophisticated functionalities.
This project offers a foundation for developing straightforward
